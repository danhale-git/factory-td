## Terrain

### Design
_The intention is to create procedurally generated deterministic terrain, with an emphasis on gameplay and limited/controlled traversal. Terrain should be broken up by cliffs with sloped providing limited/choked access between areas._

Terrain generation is based on [Worley (Cellular) noise](https://thebookofshaders.com/12/). Worley noise generation is based on [FastNoise.cs](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/fastnoise-70706).

### Cellular noise terrain generation

Cellular noise (below) is based on an even grid which can be scattered to create more natural shapes. Each cell has with a unique index (int2) in the grid.

Cellular noise, like Perlin/Simplex is deterministic but can be randomised using a seed. It is possible to generate the following information deterministically about worley for any point in world space:

* Cell the point is inside info: Index, value noise

* Closest adjacent cell info: Index, value noise

* Distance from the edge of the cell, in the direction of the closest adjacent cell (distance-to-edge)

The index can be used to determince cell height and value noise is a float between 0 and 1 unique to the cell which is useful for other procedural choices. 

To determine cell height the cell index values are used as the input for a 2D Simplex noise. The Simplex output chooses the cell height. This causes more natural, gradual height transitions between cells due to the wave shape generated by simplex noise.

Terrain generation with no scatter

For example, cell value noise is used to decide if a slope exists. Using the value of two neighbouring cells, a third consistent value can be created to decide if a slope connects them.
This allows sloped to be generated deterministically with each half of the slope owned by a different cell and both cells generated independently.
```csharp
float cellPairValue = (cellValue * adjacentValue);
bool slope = CheckIfSlopedBasedOnValue(cellPairValue);
```

Slopes generated using Cellular distance-to-edge noise.

distance-to-edge can be used to blend height between cells, where the value 0 is the edge of the current cell. The code below sloped the terrain from the cell height, to half way between it's and the adjacent cell's height.
```csharp
float slopeLength = 0.5f;

float halfWayHeight = (point.cellHeight + point.adjacentHeight) / 2;
float interpolator = math.unlerp(0, slopeLength, point.distanceToEdge);

float terrainHeight = math.lerp(halfWayHeight, cellHeight, interpolator);
```
