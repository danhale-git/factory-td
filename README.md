## Terrain

### Design
_Procedurally generate deterministic terrain, with an emphasis on gameplay and limited/controlled traversal. Terrain should be broken up by cliffs with slopes providing limited/choked access between areas._

Terrain generation is based on [Worley (Cellular) noise](https://thebookofshaders.com/12/). All noise generation is based on [FastNoise.cs](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/fastnoise-70706).

### Worley Cells

Cellular noise (below) is based on an even grid which can be scattered to create more natural shapes. Each cell has a unique grid index (int2) and unique value noise (float between 0 and 1).

### Worley Terrain

Cellular noise, like Perlin or Simplex, is deterministic but can be randomised using a seed. It is possible to generate the following (amongst other) information deterministically for any point in world space:

* Cell containing the point: Index, value noise

* Closest adjacent cell to point: Index, value noise

* Distance from the edge of the cell, in the direction of the closest adjacent cell (distance-to-edge)

Index is an int2 and value noise is a float between 0 and 1. Both are unique to each individual cell.

To determine cell height the cell index x and y values are used as the input for a 2D Simplex noise function. The Simplex output chooses the cell height. This causes more natural, gradual height transitions between cells due to the wave shape generated by simplex noise.

### Slopes

Cell value noise is used to decide if a slope exists between two neighbouring cells. Using the value of two cells, a third deterministic value can be created to decide if a slope connects them.
This allows each cell to own half a slope and be generated independently of each other.
```csharp
float cellPairValue = (cellValue * adjacentValue);
bool slope = CheckIfSlopedBasedOnValue(cellPairValue);
```

The distance-to-edge value combined with information about both the current and adjacent cells can be used to blend values between two cells, where the value 0 is the edge of the current cell. The code below slopes the terrain from the cell height, to the mid point between the two cells.
```csharp
float slopeLength = 0.5f;

float halfWayHeight = (point.cellHeight + point.adjacentHeight) / 2;
float interpolator = math.unlerp(0, slopeLength, point.distanceToEdge);

float terrainHeight = math.lerp(halfWayHeight, cellHeight, interpolator);
```
